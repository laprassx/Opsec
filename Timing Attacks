Timing attacks in cybersecurity exploit the time it takes for a system to process certain operations. By measuring the time difference between actions
(like encryption or authentication steps), attackers can infer sensitive information such as cryptographic keys or passwords.

How Timing Attacks Work:

Observation: Attackers measure the time a system takes to respond to specific inputs.

Exploitation: Small timing differences in responses can leak information about the system's internal operations.

Prevention Techniques:

Constant-Time Algorithms: Use algorithms that run in uniform time, regardless of input.
Random Delays: Introduce random processing delays to obfuscate timing measurements.
Blinding Techniques: Encrypt or randomize sensitive computations to obscure patterns.
   
Timing attacks are a subtle but significant threat, especially for systems handling cryptographic processes.

>> tor isnt fully secure 

what is a timing attack?

(In cryptography, a timing attack is a side-channel attack in which the attacker attempts to compromise a cryptosystem by analyzing the time taken to execute cryptographic algorithms.)
basically dont overlap what youre doing in simple terms eg dont say im going on tor on a insecure platform and then go on it and do crime lol..
