Key Considerations
Device Compatibility: Not all custom ROMs work with all phones. Some, like GrapheneOS, are designed for specific devices.
App Support: Privacy-centric OSes may not support every app due to limitations with Google Play Services. Consider whether you need specific apps and whether they work on the OS you're considering.
User Expertise: Some systems require a higher level of technical expertise to install and maintain, especially those like PostmarketOS or Ubuntu Touch.
These operating systems offer varying levels of privacy, security, and usability, making it important to choose the one that best fits your specific needs and comfort level.
