PGP, or Pretty Good Privacy, is useful for a variety of reasons, including: 
 
Secure communication
PGP is a software program that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages and files, making them confidential. This is especially important for sharing sensitive information, such as via email. 
 
Verifying senders
PGP can verify the sender of a message to ensure that it wasn't intercepted by a third party. 
 
Digital signatures
PGP can create digital signatures, which are like electronic fingerprints for documents. 
 
Protecting data
PGP can protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. 
 
Easy to use
PGP encryption software is easy to learn and use, even with little to no training. 
 
PGP was one of the first freely available public-key cryptography software programs, and has played a significant role in advancing secure communication.
