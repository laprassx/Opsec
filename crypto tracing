Most crypto is traceable , things such as meta sleuth exists which you can trace wallets with hence why i reccomend a good coin mixer eg simpleswap.io or 
other things such as stack wallet for there in site mixing check ⁠"crypto wallets" for what crypto wallets to use 

best thing to use is XMR with crypto for example

dirty btc ---> to xmr ----> to whatever currency 
the reason you do this is so it cant be traced for example like this
