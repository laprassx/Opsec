Metadata within images refers to the information embedded in image files that describes various
attributes of the image itself. This metadata can include a range of details, such as technical information, 
descriptive data, and more. Image metadata is typically stored in specific formats, such as EXIF (Exchangeable
Image File Format), IPTC (International Press Telecommunications Council), or XMP (Extensible Metadata Platform).

Types of Image Metadata:
EXIF Metadata (Exchangeable Image File Format):

Camera settings: Information about the camera model, lens type, focal length, shutter speed, aperture, ISO, etc.
Timestamp: The date and time the image was taken.
Geolocation: GPS coordinates where the image was captured (if enabled on the camera or smartphone).
File format: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, etc.
IPTC Metadata (International Press Telecommunications Council):

Author/Creator: Name of the photographer or organization responsible for the image.
Title or Caption: A brief description or title of the image.
Keywords: Tags that describe the imageâ€™s content for easier searchability.
Copyright: Ownership information and usage rights.
XMP Metadata (Extensible Metadata Platform):

Custom Data: XMP allows for the addition of custom metadata fields, often used in professional image editing 
software (like Adobe Photoshop) to store non-standardized information such as edits made to the image.
Uses of Image Metadata:
Organizing and Searching: Descriptive metadata like tags, titles, or keywords make it easier to categorize, sort,
and find images in large collections.Copyright and Ownership: Metadata can store copyright and usage rights information, 
helping to protect intellectual property and prevent unauthorized use.
Image Optimization and Editing: EXIF metadata provides useful insights for photographers and editors, like camera settings,
helping to adjust editing techniques or optimize future shots.Tracking and Geolocation: Geotagging allows users to map where photos 
were taken, useful in travel photography or for law enforcement to track locations. Digital Forensics: Image metadata can provide crucial
evidence about the time, location, and device used to take a photo, making it  useful in investigations.
Preservation: Metadata helps in long-term preservation and archiving, ensuring that image details and context are maintained
for future reference. How to View Image Metadata: On a computer: Right-click an image file, select "Properties" 
(Windows) or "Get Info" (Mac), and navigate to the "Details" or "Info" tab. Using Software: Programs like Adobe Photoshop, 
Lightroom, or online tools can show more advanced metadata, including custom fields.
By utilizing metadata, images can be better understood, organized, and protected.
