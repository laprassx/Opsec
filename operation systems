https://tails.net/ Use this on a usb and watch a video on how to set it up dont fuck it up with the persistance storage, dont use a bridge unless you need to by someform of law as people get 
into a lot of shit in places like the middle east for using this ok? perfect , only thing a bridge does is basically just not inform your isp that you are on tor and also dont use tor with a 
vpn on its fucking autistic if youre not gonna use tails dont go on tor atp usbs are like $9 or something so just do it its worth the time and its easy to set up , plug in usb after its set
up and bang fully isolated and when you pull it out its clears everything other than what you put on your persistant storage

Whonix is one of the best if you set it up right.

Linux 
Yet again linux is a lot more secure than windows , you can use things such as KALI to arch and use your own proxys on there 
and other things windows hasnt ever be very secure so id always avoid it if youre extreamly paranoid for say , also check encrypted drives as id consider encrypting your linux vm ect

yet again you can always buy VPS ( virtual private servers) if u wanted to thats anotehr alternative!
