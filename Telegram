https://telegram.org/ telegram

telegram is a "secure messanger" the only issue is the owner got arrested with conspiary ect which is 
linked to him not accepting Emergency data requests ect dont get me wrong its better than discord by 
miles but frankly id just avoid it for now and go to things such as session ( my personal go to) 

with telegram make it using a voip 
good providers are
https://www.smspool.net/
https://juicysms.com/
https://monerosms.com/
( just use xmr untracable crypto btw) and a vpn on site

Also use a proxy at all times  dont forget dont have it on your phone if u can avoid it 
for example if you made it on preferably a phone with a vpn eg mullvad and then removed 
yourself off the phone and wiped the data off it so they cant make data requests as lots of
people get fucked due ot phone data requests instead of actual opsec issues within telegram
