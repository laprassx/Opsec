(Information Requests
Between April 1 2024 and June 30 2024 , there were 12 inquiries or requests from law
enforcement agencies.
Our Response
Our response to all requests for personal information of users explained that Session abided by
privacy-by-design principles to protect human rights defenders, journalists, whistleblowers and
other at-risk communities that require maximum privacy. The content of messages are endto-end encrypted and communicated through a decentralised onion-routed network, which
means that there is no way for the Session team to discover the content of a message or the IP
or other personal identification information of users sending or receiving messages. Therefore,
we cannot provide information that could help LEAs identify a user. )

only downsides is that its slow frankly
