Dont edate

dont overlap alises

dont share other socials that could be linked feds can find them

dont tell people irl who you are or what  you do 

if you give out other accounts make sure there secure too like for example voips or ect and dont fucking give out your number unless its a fake sim / burner sim ( maybe travel a city or more away if you buy it and buy it in cash ) but just dont do it ngl

detrace names online so they arent linked too helps

also Being mindful of shadows and birthmarks and stuff in pics and dont share your face or anything identable, 
Lowering image quality to make things harder to pull off
and dont show finger prints
